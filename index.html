            <h2>CIS(P)A is now back for the fourth time. And this time Obama says he’ll sign it.</h2>
            <p>Senator Mitch McConnell has introduced CISA as an amendment to the must-pass Defense Authorization bill. This is how Congress typically sneaks through the worst bills. This marks the fourth time Congress is trying to pass this bill to allow corporations to share our personal data with governments more loosely. Unlike in the past, Obama now supports CISA and has been calling for its passage.</p>
            <p>The bill gives legal immunity to companies that share personal data with the government in the name of cyber security. In reality, the government would use the data they receive under the bill as a way to justify warrantless mass surveillance of domestic Internet traffic. It’s purely a surveillance bill -- nothing in it is actually designed to improve security.</p>
            <p>The NSA and members of Congress want to pass CISA so badly, they’re using the recent hack of the Office of Personnel Management as justification for bringing this back up and rushing it through. In reality, the OPM hack just shows that the government is not a good steward of sensitive data. The truth is that CISA could not have prevented the OPM hack, and even Senator McConnell couldn't explain how it could have. Congress and the NSA are using the same hysteria over cyber security time and time again to try to ram CISA into law.</p>
            <p>CISA won't prevent hacking. It will be used and abused to conduct even deeper surveillance into the lives of Internet users worldwide. You can stop them by taking action again. We've stopped CISA before, let's do it again. Please use the form above to email your senators and then share this page with your friends.</p>

            <h2>Big Tech and the NSA both want to pass CIS(P)A. And that should scare you.</h2>
            <p>
                Recent news reports reveal that the NSA has been pressuring their most powerful defenders in Congress to reintroduce CISA -- the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Act. This bill would allow corporations to share our private data with the government more easily, and with complete legal immunity. No wonder NSA chief Keith Alexander has been begging Congress for years to pass a CISA bill, and the trade groups led by Google and other tech giants <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57579480-38/google-yahoo-microsoft-execs-back-cispa-through-trade-group/" target="_blank"><strong>are on board</strong></a>.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                We need to stop CISA for good this time. Let's make this the last time they try anything like CISA. Email Congress and share this page now.
